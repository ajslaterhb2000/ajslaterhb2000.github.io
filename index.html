          <p>This is a video game without a game engine. This project was It has been the biggest software project that I have been apart of so far with 7 
            developers. We used agile devopment to try and reign in the chaos, but for some cases I learned first hand why best practices exist. We met multiple
            times a week for stand up, pair programming sessions, and integration between branches. 
          </p>
          <p>On the technical side this game was made with C++ using OpenGl for the graphics, Asimp for importing the animations, Boost Asio for networking and SFML for the audio. 
             I mainly worked on the networking for this game, we used the TCP protocol communication because the demo for our project was occured with all the computers on the same
             large bandwith, high speed network. 
          </p>
          <p>You can download the game from the repo below, as long as you have a Windows machine and Visual Studio with CMake</p>

          <p> The project was a final for a computer animation course I took at UCSD. I selected this as a final project
             because it gave me a chance to see how quaternions are practically used. While quaternions as a concept 
             were difficult for me to understand, in code they were much easier to manage than Euler angles and also made
             interpolation between poses look very simple</p>
            <p> This project has two different interpolation techinuqes of both spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) and Catmull-Rom algorithm. 
                The SLERP works similar to linear interpolation but it takes into account the angle between two different quaternions.
                The Catmull-Rom works by treating the interpolation as between multiple quaternions not just two. It is similar to a spline.
                This allows for a much smoother transition between poses than even slerp. Don't just take my word for it, download it and run it for yourself

                Inspired by Andrew Kelsers raytracer business card, I wanted to try and write a raytracer that could be condensed and to
                the size of a buisness card as well. The idea is to try and condense the relatively small amount of code it takes to 
                do basic raytracing to the size of a business card and have it render an image out. In order to run this code go to the repo
                and with your C++ compiler type (my compiler is g++).
            </p>

                This project is fun because it starts with some very simple math and quickly advances in complexity and realism. 
                This project just handles sphere intersections, point lights for lighting, and simple diffuse, 
                and mirror surfaces for now. I look forward to continue expanding upon this as my knowledge of rendering grows.
