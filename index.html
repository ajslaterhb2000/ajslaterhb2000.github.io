            developers. We used agile devopment to try and reign in the chaos, but for some cases I learned first hand why best practices exist. We met multiple
            times a week for stand up, pair programming sessions, and integration between branches.

        <h3>Developer Process: Agile Development</h3>
        <p>Developing the Tag Guys game was a significant undertaking that required effective project management and collaboration. We employed Agile Development methodologies to enhance our productivity and adapt to evolving requirements. Here's an overview of our developer process:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Regular Meetings:</strong> We conducted multiple weekly meetings, including stand-up sessions, to discuss progress, address challenges, and ensure alignment among team members.</li>
          <li><strong>Pair Programming:</strong> We embraced pair programming sessions, where two developers collaborated closely on coding tasks. This fostered knowledge sharing, improved code quality, and accelerated our development process.</li>
          <li><strong>Branch Integration:</strong> Integration between branches was a crucial aspect of our workflow. We dedicated specific sessions to integrate individual work into the main project, ensuring a cohesive and functional product.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our commitment to Agile Development enabled us to navigate the complexities of the project efficiently, maintain transparency, and deliver a high-quality game experience.</p>
        <h3>Technical Details</h3>
        <p>Tag Guys was built using a combination of powerful technologies:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>C++ and OpenGL:</strong> We utilized C++ programming language in conjunction with OpenGL for graphics rendering, providing visually immersive gameplay.</li>
          <li><strong>Asimp:</strong> To import and incorporate animations seamlessly, we leveraged Asimp, a library that supports multiple animation formats.</li>
          <li><strong>Boost Asio:</strong> Networking functionality was implemented using Boost Asio, which facilitated smooth communication between game instances for seamless multiplayer experiences.</li>
          <li><strong>SFML:</strong> The game's audio system was implemented using SFML, enabling us to create an immersive soundscape for players.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As a member of the development team, my primary focus was on networking implementation, leveraging the TCP protocol for reliable communication. This choice proved ideal for our project's initial demo, which involved computers connected to a high-speed, high-bandwidth network.</p>

          <p> The project was a final for a computer animation course I took at UCSD. I selected this as a final project
             because it gave me a chance to see how quaternions are practically used. While quaternions as a concept 
             were difficult for me to understand, in code they were much easier to manage than Euler angles and also made
             interpolation between poses look very simple</p>
            <p> This project has two different interpolation techinuqes of both spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) and Catmull-Rom algorithm. 
                The SLERP works similar to linear interpolation but it takes into account the angle between two different quaternions.
                The Catmull-Rom works by treating the interpolation as between multiple quaternions not just two. It is similar to a spline.
                This allows for a much smoother transition between poses than even slerp. Don't just take my word for it, download it and run it for yourself

                Inspired by Andrew Kelsers raytracer business card, I wanted to try and write a raytracer that could be condensed and to
                the size of a buisness card as well. The idea is to try and condense the relatively small amount of code it takes to 
                do basic raytracing to the size of a business card and have it render an image out. In order to run this, copy the code, and then compile with

                This project is fun because it starts with some very simple math and quickly advances in complexity and realism. 
                This project just handles sphere intersections, point lights for lighting, and simple diffuse, 
                and mirror surfaces for now. I look forward to continue expanding upon this as my knowledge of rendering grows.
